Summary:

The assignment let me learn how to draw a consistent and how to apply what we learnt from previous task to adjust our rotations with the pop and push function beside the camera movement for up,down,right and left with arrows in functions: lookright(),lookleft(),lookup() and lookdown() and the zooming in functions moveForward() and moveBackward() that the structure and the logic are implemented in my code at these function and by using a helper function rotatepoint(),crossproduct(),normalize()

Problems and how I solved:

In the begging I had a problem to draw the full body and let it consistent that the hand in previous task was very simple in drawing but this take me much time to draw in different points up and down relative to each other so I revised the concept of pop and push so that I can draw.

The idea of rotation of shoulder or leg wasn’t obvious to me at begging but I added keys and variables with new rotation angle glrotate() to solve this problem but now right hand and leg don’t  rotate at same time with left hand and leg
